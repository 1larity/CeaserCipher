CeaserCipher
============

A very quick and dirty caesar cipher coder/decoder for Android * Written to determine the cipher in a GCHQ code breaking competition.

Please note this cipher is completely insecure and can be cracked with pencil and paper in a matter of minutes. This app is just for fun and should not be used for important secure communications.

You can also use the app to check if encrypted text is encrypted with a Caesar cipher by placing the encryption in the plaintext box and cycling through all letter shifts.

Accepts common punctuations, numbers upper and lower case alphabets (76 shifts),
